## Synopsis
Broken into two parts, the first concerns Frankel's time in four concentration camps and is told dispassionately and as a series of almost impressionistic anecdotes of his time enduring the horrors of the Holocaust. The second part of the book outlines Frankel's *logotherapy*, "the third school of Viennese psychotherapy", as Frankel calls it. Frankel posits that a "will to meaning" is mankind's primary motivation in life, and his time during World War II serves as a case study in the motivational power of striving for meaning even when confronted with monumental and senseless suffering.
## Key Ideas
**logotherapy and the will to meaning**
Frankel contends that "man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life" (99), and in contrast to Nietzche's *will to power* or Freud's *will to pleasure*, man's first order priority is a *will to meaning*.

**what is meaning**
How you find meaning in life is how you respond to the events presented to you, or "each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible"

**3 paths to meaning**
1. doing a task or deed (work)
2. encountering someone (love)
3. responding to life's situations (responsibleness)

**delusion of the reprieved**
The condemned man, on the precipice of death, believes he might be reprieved at any moment.

**let me be worth of my suffering**
Dostoevksy said "there is one thing that I dread: not to be worth of my sufferings", which doesn't mean that he wants all suffering he is encumbered with to be deserved but rather that he can rise to the test of his suffering; prove the mettle of his character when confronted with senseless suffering.

## Counter Ideas
I wonder if the validity of *logotherapy* is moreso a product of man's will to community, and that the act of therapy and community with a therapist, to actually be heard, is the more performative function. A will to meaning can be a catch-all for any argument, as a will to meaning might encompass a will to community, or a will to power, or a will to pleasure, all if a person derives life's meaning through those pursuits. Frankel was an already established professional before the Holocaust, so I wonder how much of the established thought patterns pushed the theory's codification.

Frankel, in a 1983 postscript essay on *A Case for Tragic Optimism*, attributes the drug pandemic of the time on a pandemic of meaningless, but I think the claim is dubious at best. I wonder what the numbers say in terms of drug usage, increased access/supply, etc. I'd think the impetus to abuse drugs and the lack of social safety nets to catch those who fall are more complicated than some cultural psychological malaise. What thinker hasn't bemoaned their generations nihilism? And psychologists aren't de facto sociologists.

## Quotes
> Apathy [...] was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. (28)

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way. (66)

> Without suffereing and death human life would not be complete. (67)

> Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. (77)

> No one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them. (90)

## Review
I've consumed a lot of Holocaust media in my life. None of it gets any easier to stomach. Frankel's account might lack the visceral punch of Edith Eger's **The Choice** or narrative bleakness of Wiesel's **Night**, but each survivor deals with their trauma in their own way. Frankel's telling relies less on the strictures of narrative and exists as a series of impressionistic anecdotes, and for that it might not hit as drastically, but these stories are always compelling.

As for the takeaway, Frankel is arguing that you play the cards you've been dealt as best you can, and there is meaning in playing the hand well and honorably, regardless of how shit the hand is.
