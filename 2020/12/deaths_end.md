## Synopsis
Wraps up the entire three book Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy and the plot's of **The Dark Forest** and **The Three-Body Problem** that came before, which left us with Luo Ji as the final
Wallfacer and in a stasis with the Trisolarans because of the discovery of the dark forest deterrence theory. This book follows Cheng Xin, an erstwhile aerospace engineer and observer the the final days of the earth's solar system. Eventually, humanity triggers dark forest deterrence and Trisolaris is destroyed, confirming the dark forest theory and putting a real and unavoidable counter on the end of humanity in the Solar System. Eventually, the dark forest attack comes, which is an unavoidable crushing of three dimensional space into two dimensional space, and the entirety of Earth's Solar System is destroyed. Cheng Xin escapse on a curvature propelled lightspeed ship to the star Yun Tianming bought her to meet him. Yun Tianming is a brain that humanity shot into space to infiltrate the Trisolarans.

## Key Ideas
Cheng Xin makes two decisions that decide the fate of humanity:

1. Not to activate dark forest deterrence when faced with a Trisolaran attack
2. Not to allow the lightspeed drive research to continue, dooming humanity to entombment once the Solar System lost a dimension

These decisions

## Counter Ideas
Just a thought, but Cixin Liu has been an outspoken proponent of the Chinese Communist Party. One of the quotes being bandied about is:

>> Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty [...] If you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.

I wonder how much this ideology seeps into the book. Cheng Xin's actions on their face were about 'love' as Gang Yuifan says at the end, but there is an undercurrent of submission to state and hegemony that can be argued underwrite all virtuous paths in the book.

There has been talk of canceling the upcoming Netflix adaptation, which I disagree with, although Liu does seem to be willing to at least parrot his country's talking points while they very clearly perpetuate human right's atrocities against the Uighur.

## Review
Liu is a fantastic world builder and narrative crafter. His characters are still wooden and mostly plot devices. Cheng Xin also does a bit to set back compelling female characters in science fiction. Other than that though, the book pulled you back in like you were light trying to escape an event horizon. Narratively, it's his tightest book of the three and therefore least narratively ambitious, but it works for this story. I would say all three books in the series hew to different genres, and this one most closely resembles a space opera than any of the previous two, it is just couched in a hell of a well-crafted world.

I find this book compelling on so many levels, and while I have a lot of loophole style questions about contradictions within the world Liu built (as in, if Trisolarans knew enough to know that there was a way to broadcast a safety message, why didn't they divulge it -- why were they so secretive when they were no longer going to earth?), I found the ideas immensely compelling and the plot well-paced. This is a good science fiction book, and while I know that Jemisin's conclusory novel **The Stone Sky** was an excellent science fiction book and was well-deserving of the Hugo, I could hear a compelling case that this book deserved it in 2017 over Jemisin's three-peat.
