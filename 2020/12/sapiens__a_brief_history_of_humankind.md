## Synopsis
Harari walks through the history of Homo Sapiens through three revolutions: 1) The Cognitive Revolution 2) The Agricultural Revolution 3) The Scientific Revolution. His central thesis is that humans ability for fictive language, speaking and thinking of things that don't exist, is key to their survival, and that all human structures that exist exist solely in the human imagination, and that through these myths is how we have built social cohesion and have catapulted to the top of the food chain.

## Key Ideas
**the power of myths**
Everything humans have devised is an imagined myth, from religion to capitalism to money to any other ideology, and in order to replace these inter-subjective myths (myths that a collective believes in and thus a collective needs to disavow) other, equally or more precisely compelling myths need to be devised.

**forces unifying humanity**
1. money
2. empire
3. religion

**2 chaos systems**
1. 1st order chaos - doesn't respond to predictions about it, e.g. weather
2. 2nd order chaos - predictions affect outcomes, e.g. politics, revolutions, markets

**imagined communities**
Groups of people organized around some idea, from nation down to consumer trend, e.g. Germany or Madonna fans

**other bits**
- humans killed all the fauna of australia -- it used to be filled with huge armadillos and sloths
- science and empire are inextricably linked -- even Darwin's initial geological survey was as part of a naval reconnaissance
- Mississippi Company Bubble (from 1719-20) - a huge prospecting bubble that might have contributed to France being unable to finance as much New World conquering as England and contributed to England's dominance in the New World
- humanity's precipitous jump up the food chain might explain some of it's worst tendencies of nastiness
- story of Diogenes, founder of the school of Cynics, when asked by Alex the Great if there was anything he wanted h, he told Alex to move left and get out of his sunshine

## Counter Ideas
There are a few reviews out there saying the Harari is engaging in pop history and Harper Collins is fashioning him as an historical Malcolm Gladwell, as in, a brand folk impulsively buy. I don't buy the former, as his citations are solid (most are actually not in the book but listed on his site). The latter is how this works. I think the ideas here presented, even if old fodder for philosophers, are important and compelling.

## Quotes
> The first wave of Sapiens colonisation was one of the biggest and swiftest ecological disasters to befall the animal kingdom (72)

> One of histories iron clad laws is that luxuries become necessities and spawn obligations. (87)

> History is something very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets. (101)

> Biology enables, culture forbids. (147)

> Consistency is the playground of dull minds. (165)

> Money is the most universal and efficient system of universal trust ever devised. (180)

> Religion can be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a believe in a superhuman order. (210)

> Today's elites usually justify superiority in terms of historical differences between cultures rather than biological differences between race. (303)

> Today, a single affluent family generally has more timepieces at home than an entire medieval country. (355)

> Most of the traditional functions of families and communities were handed over to states and markets. (356)

> [The decades since WWII] were the most peaceful era in human history. (366)

> The decline of violence is largely to the rise of the state. (367)

> For real peace is not the absence of ware. Real peace is the implausibility of war. (371)

> As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. (390)

## Review
If all this book were was the first few chapters, I'd have still immensely enjoyed it. Harari veers towards the uncomfortably forthright at times regarding biology, religion, and humanity's bitter past, but the pedal point is always that all structures are myths and are not real, although their effects are all too real.

The latter half and in particular the last few chapters delve into a more speculative nature, but if the lesson wasn't learned earlier that Harari isn't presenting every theory as truth (two notable exceptions: animal cruelty and Buddhism) but rather as a survey, that should be taken into account when he prognosticates.

This isn't an historians book as much as its an intro to humanity written by an historian, and I found that to be compelling, even if the philosophical underpinnings are also philosophy 101.
