## Synopsis
Fukuyama builds on Marx and Hegel's evocation of history as an evolution defined by unique epochs of development and posits that the history finds its culmination in liberal democracy, a liberal democracy that is not dialectical, i.e. that is free of contradictions. Liberal democracy suits mankind because it enables man's greatest drive, the drive for recognition, by allowing the 'thymotic' man to participation and allows for the realization (and balance) of liberty and equality. At the end of history is a last man, one who can be both satisfied and happy, as equal or as liberated as the particular liberal democracy they find themselves in allows.

## Key Takeaway
1. Humanity greatness (or worthiness) lies in its ability to subdue animal instincts for the greater good. We might call this greatness 'dignity', although whether mankind alone has 'dignity' is a logical well to fall into.
2. Liberty and equality are counter-balanced against each other.

## Key Ideas
### mans desire for recognition; thymos
Fukuyama, building off of Marx and Hegel, states that human's prime desire is for recognition, for thymos, and that history can be told not as one of technological advance or philosophical insight but as the exercise of *megalothymia*. This is a variant of the *Great Man* hypothesis, that history is the story of a few *Great Men* who single-handedly move history's needle.

### natural man
Fukuyama dedicates a fair bit of space to 'natural man', evolving the philosophical underpinnings of the conception from the Lockean conception of the twin American and French revolutions on to Marx and then Hegel's conception. The discussion is compelling and might merit further reading, but as a takeaway, it drives at what makes man free and different than other animals.

## Counter Ideas
There are several counter theories to Fukuyama's work. Wikipedia has a good synopsis, but I'll add the below:

### technology
One of Fukuyama's weaknesses is that he isn't a technologist and shares that 20th century paralytic fear of nuclear warfare. If you look at the largest forces at work in the 20th century, nuclear proliferation is only a small component -- there are far larger warning signs from biological warfare/contagion, climate change, the internet and the rise of tailored propaganda, or any of the other local catastrophes that prove far more disastrous to far more people than the prospect of a civilization-ending nuclear war.

## Quotes

> history [can be] understood as a single, coherent, evolutionary process (vii)

> Democracy can never enter through the back door. (220)

> There is no conflict between religion and liberal democracy except at the point where religion ceases to be tolerant or egalitarian. (216)

> The modern liberal democratic world [...] is free of contradictions. (139)

> Modern liberal democracy is based on twin principles of libert and equality. The two are in perpetual tension: equality cannot be maximized without the intervention of a powerful state that limits individual liberty; liberty cannot be expanded indefinitely without inviting various pernicious forms of social inequality. (346)

> culture arises out of the capacity to evaluate (213)

> [The desire for recognition] suggests a very different way of reading the historical process, not as the story of the unfolding of modern natural science or of the logic of economic development, but rather as the emergence, growth, and eventual decline of *megalothymia*. (189)

## Review
**Hegel, Marx, and Neitzche, walk into a bar...**
Postmodernism is the end of everything, the disbanding of the mythos of human culture for the last two thousand years, culminating in a mass exodus into the unreality of the real, the place where humanity is a social animal that learned self-control and built fictional structures to perpetuate that . As a species we've either outgrown the need for the myth (God is dead), or the myth has reached an equilibrium free of dialectical contradictions (liberal democracy). This work falls into the latter camp.

Fukuyama never quite delivers on the bombast of the title, hiding and hedging behind other's philosophical arguments, but the book is important. In the 20 plus years since it's publication, it's central thesis of history as an evolution ending with liberal democracy is all the more validated, and offers a good (and approachable) dialogue between some of history's most prescient thinkers in Kant, Hegel, Marx, Rousseau, Locke, etc. It is easy to be compelled by this dialogue, and the narrative Fukuyama builds from them.

It's not without its misses though -- it's easy to circle in red ink the misses of a book proclaiming the end of history, a book of prophecy. Chief among the concerns is that Fukuyama isn't a technologist, and I don't think the full story of world culture within the last 30 years can be told without mentioning the effect of the internet. Also, Fukuyama misses the rise of anocracies (Russia, the appeal of Donald Trump). Wikipedia tells me that from 1989 to 2013, the number of anocracies increased from 30 to 53.

Regardless, it *is* an important work and deserving of the attention.
