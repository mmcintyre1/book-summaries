## Synopsis
The novel exists on three levels centered on a 999-line poem, "in heroic couplets [...] divided into four cantos" (13) written by fictional poet John Shade and sandwiched between a lengthy foreword and commentary written by Shade's neighbor, Charles Kinbote, the self-styled deposed king of fictional Zembla. Kinbote, throughout the Commentary, interjects his autobiographical deposition from Zembla into the highly autobiographical source poem, Pale Fire, which concerns the loss of Shade's daughter and serves as momento mori of his daughter's death and meditation on death itself. The ultimate effect is that it is difficult to separate fact from fiction, inventor from invented.
## Key Ideas
**inventor and invented**

Throughout the novel, it's hard to tell what is real and what is unreality, Fitzgerald's "promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing". Nabokov is a master puzzle smith and the novel works on at least three realities:
1. Shade is the only 'real' character, and Kinbote and Gradus are his inventions to mask a suicide
2. Kinbote is real and Shade is his invention
3. Everyone is as they seem, ie, "a lunatic who intends to kill an imaginary king, another lunatic who imagines himself to be that king, and a distinguished old poet who stumbles by chance into the line of fire, and perishes in the clash between the two figments". (301)

Kinbote mentions that there are "always 'three nights' in fairy tales" (190) -- is it possible that nights is a double-entendre for knight?

**color**

Throughout the novel, there are references to colors and gemstones, azure, emerald, topaz, shade, daughter Hazel, etc. In fact, 'pale' can be used as an attribute of a color's vibrancy.

**dogs**

There are three references to dogs throughout the novel. No thoughts, just an observation.

**pale fire and shakespeare**

You can read this as a satire of literary scholarship generally, further evidenced by Kinbote's inability to catch the Shakespeare reference of the title (from Timon of Athens). Kinbote even quotes the relevant lines, but because he has "no library in the desolate log cabin where I live", he is prompted to "retranslate [...] into English prose from a Zemblan peotrical version of *Timon* (79-80).

There are other points where Kinbote flat out misses references because of cultural illiteracy (Chapman's Homer), or gives up on elucidation (lemniscate).

It's a funny novel -- the maniacal serial killer prowling the pages to the ultimate surrender is crippled by diarrhea, Kinbote is a maniacal stalker, etc.

## Quotes
> the basic fact that "reality" is neither the subject nor the object of true art which creates its own special reality having nothing to do with the average "reality" perceived by the communal eye. (130)

> I have no desire to twist and batter an unambiguous *appartus criticus* into the monstrous semblance of a novel. (86)

> He [Shade] was his own cancellation. (26)

> One knew that bedtime was closing in with all its terrors; that in a few minutes the toe would prod and worry the slipper, and then disappear with it from my golden field of vision traversed by the black bendlet of a branch. (23)

Nabokov has such a way with language that you find yourself in solidarity with a lunatic stalker. The elegant mania.

> My notes and self are petering out. (300)

Kinbote is tied inextricably with his notes.
