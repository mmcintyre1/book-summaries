## Synopsis
The novel exists on three levels centered on a 999-line poem, "in heroic couplets [...] divided into four cantos" (13) written by fictional poet John Shade and sandwiched between a lengthy foreword and commentary written by Shade's neighbor, Charles Kinbote, the self-styled deposed king of fictional Zembla. Kinbote, throughout the Commentary, interjects his autobiographical deposition from Zembla into the highly autobiographical source poem, Pale Fire, which concerns the loss of Shade's daughter and serves as momento mori of his daughter's death and meditation on death itself. The ultimate effect is that it is difficult to separate fact from fiction, inventor from invented.
## Key Ideas
**inventor and invented**

Throughout the novel, it's hard to tell what is real and what is unreality, Fitzgerald's "promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing". Nabokov is a master puzzle smith and the novel works on at least three realities:
1. Shade is the only 'real' character, and Kinbote and Gradus are his inventions to mask a suicide
2. Kinbote is real and Shade is his invention
3. Everyone is as they seem, ie, "a lunatic who intends to kill an imaginary king, another lunatic who imagines himself to be that king, and a distinguished old poet who stumbles by chance into the line of fire, and perishes in the clash between the two figments". (301)

Kinbote mentions that there are "always 'three nights' in fairy tales" (190) -- is it possible that nights is a double-entendre for knight?

**color**

Throughout the novel, there are references to colors and gemstones, azure, emerald, topaz, shade, daughter Hazel, etc. In fact, 'pale' can be used as an attribute of a color's vibrancy.

**dogs**

There are three references to dogs throughout the novel. No thoughts, just an observation.

**pale fire and shakespeare**

You can read this as a satire of literary scholarship generally, further evidenced by Kinbote's inability to catch the Shakespeare reference of the title (from Timon of Athens). Kinbote even quotes the relevant lines, but because he has "no library in the desolate log cabin where I live", he is prompted to "retranslate [...] into English prose from a Zemblan peotrical version of *Timon* (79-80).

There are other points where Kinbote flat out misses references because of cultural illiteracy (Chapman's Homer), or gives up on elucidation (lemniscate).

It's a funny novel -- the maniacal serial killer prowling the pages to the ultimate surrender is crippled by diarrhea, Kinbote is a maniacal stalker, etc.

## Quotes
> the basic fact that "reality" is neither the subject nor the object of true art which creates its own special reality having nothing to do with the average "reality" perceived by the communal eye. (130)

> I have no desire to twist and batter an unambiguous *appartus criticus* into the monstrous semblance of a novel. (86)

> He [Shade] was his own cancellation. (26)

> One knew that bedtime was closing in with all its terrors; that in a few minutes the toe would prod and worry the slipper, and then disappear with it from my golden field of vision traversed by the black bendlet of a branch. (23)

Nabokov has such a way with language that you find yourself in solidarity with a lunatic stalker. The elegant mania.

> My notes and self are petering out. (300)

Kinbote is tied inextricably with his notes.

> These heart-rending dreams transformed the drab prose of his feelings for her into strong and strange poetry, subsiding undulations of which would flash and disturb him throughout the day, bringing back the pang and the richness -- and then only the pang, and then only its glancing reflection -- but not affecting at all his attitude towards the real Disa. (209)

## Review
Is Pale Fire, the poem at the heart of this novel, itself a classic? It certainly insists upon itself, only to be tossed into the corner by Kinbote, the narrator who may or may not exist, and made to carry Kinbote's delusions in a sedan chair. The only reason I wouldn't immediately default to Pale Fire being its own masterpiece is the trepidation that Nabokov is playing some sort of game here, some sort of bait and switch or elaborate puzzle that means Pale Fire is really sarcasm and satire. One could be permitted though to ignore the layers and appreciate Pale Fire on its merits as a honeyed send-up to the 18th and 19th century masters of the heroic couplet.

This might be Nabokov's finest novel. On my edition, Updike says that Nabokov writes prose 'ecstatically', which I think is pretty close to the mark. Nabokov's characters continue the modern tradition of the Buffoon, the jester, the performative stunt pilotry of word and phrase and metaphor hiding a deeply delusional character who can at once subdue their dream world through honeyed prose and be completely removed from the real. Depending on who you think is real or not real sways the interpretation of events, proving the greatest puzzle of the novel. One can omit the entirety of the subtext, however, and enjoy Pale Fire as both a poem and a delusional pre and post script novel and come away sated. This novel is one of the finest I've read.
