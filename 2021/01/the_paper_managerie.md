## Synopsis
Ken Liu has selected 15 of his short stories (out of a total of more than 70 works) to comprise this compendium. The stories deal with history, immigration, the composition and preservation of culture, and alienation, either as a mother from her son or a immigrant to her country.
## Key Ideas
### alienation: parental
Several stories deal with a child being alienated from their parents, via technology like *Simulacrum*, or society via *The Paper Menagerie*.

### alienation: societal
plight of the immigrant, what to preserve when integrating into new culture (either from China to America or America to outer space)

## Quotes
> Every act of communication is a miracle of translation. (VII)

> 'Japan' and 'China' do not exist. They are just words, fiction [...] But these myths have powerful magic, and they require sacrifices. They require the slaughter of men like sheep. (The Literomancer - 97)

> "Everything passes, Hiroto," Dad said. "That feeling in your heart: it's called *mono no aware*. It is a sense of the transience of all things in life. The sun, the dandelion, the cicada, the Hammer, and all of us: we are all subject to the equations of James Clerk Maxwell, and we are all ephemeral patterns destined to eventually fade, whether in a second or an eon." (Mono No Aware - 244)

> But we have now come to the end of history [...] History is a narrative enterprise, and the telling of stories that are true, that affirm and explain our existence, si the fundamental task of the historian. But truth is delicate, and it has many enemies. (433)

## Vocab
**thalassocracy** [ thal-uh-sok-ruh-see ]: dominion over the seas, as in exploration, trade, or colonization.

## Review
I came to Ken Liu after reading Cixin Liu's *Remembrance of Earth's Past* remarkable trilogy, of which Ken Liu translated the first and third novels. Owing to those translations being, in my extremely unqualified opinion, superior to Martinsen's second novel translation (my sole rubric of excellence here was how wooden the dialogue felt, which might have suffered no diffraction in the translation), I picked up what I had heard was a well-regarded and well-laureled book of short stories.

Although Ken Liu is 'American' in the sense that that is the issuing authority on his passport, so many of his stories deal with the alienation of a stranger in a strange land and are quintessentially 'Chinese' or 'Chinese-America', and so in an effort to add a pinch of flavor to an otherwise very white, very anglo-saxon, (sadly, still very male) field of science-fiction I read Liu's work.

Liu's stories are stellar -- I've always figured there are two (at least!) varieties of science fiction writers -- speculative fiction about humanity's trajectory and character fiction about humans with technology sitting like Chekhov's gun on the mantel. I would consign Cixin Liu, or Frank Hebert, to the former category. The latter is where space opera has been relegated to, but also where Asimov often writes (although the Foundation series might more formally belong to the former classification) and is probably the more literary of the genre insomuch as it is concerned with the spaces within a human and between them. Liu's stories fall into this bucket -- some don't even feel like proper science fiction (although there is plenty of sci-fi fodder here), and it is easy to see how *The Paper Menagerie* won sci-fi's highest honors, but also a World Fantasy Award. None of this feels like some of the genre-bending stunt pilotry of David Mitchell, although the staples are on display here (cyberpunk noir, space opera, short story documentary), but it doesn't have to. It's just a tightly wound and intricately woven group of short stories about what it means to be a human, that is, lost in the world and alone, seeking that divine act of translation, communication.
