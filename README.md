# book-summaries

## TODO
Think about switching things over to JSON -- might be easier to display a 'digest' page in HTML, as the single column stack of text doesn't scan very well quickly, and it is hard to distinguish between headings and info. It'd certainly be easier to parse and run statistics on, which I'd probably need to write a simple parser to do anyway.

## overview
This is a repository meant to serve as a central location for the summaries of books I've read. The idea here is to be able to go back to these summaries and remember important or salient topics more readily. Most great ideas have already been expressed and real success lies in knowing how to curate and cultivate things others much smarter than myself have already said. Eventually, I'll be able to parse statistics on this. Once I have the fulltext, I use a few separate scripts to pull out things like word count and flesch kincaid score, and I think these data points are more illustrative of reading volume. I approach this like I approach everything, as in, obsessively.

Needless to say, these summaries include spoilers for plot-driven books.

## other bits
I keep most of this stuff in intermediary journals which, until I had the idea to type these out and put them in a central location with a standard format, were always difficult to quickly review or recall, and writing is so damn slow generally. Writing isn't generally good for my thought style, which is, as you can see from the previous sentence and this sentence here, riddled with overzealously long parenthetical thoughts, and I often lose their motion halfway through and am stuck on mediocre words just to keep the flow of writing continuous.

Once I put the scripts I use into a more formalized fashion, I'll probably upload them to this repo for posterity.

While this repo is public, this is intended as a 'personal' tool, but if anyone else finds use in these, that's great too.
